=head1 NAME

Algorithm::BFS - A functional approach to the breadth-first-search algorithm.

This implementation supports both cyclic and acyclic graphs but does not
support edge or vertex weighting.

Version 0.01

=head1 SYNOPSIS

    use Algorithm::BFS;

    # Create your object.
    my $bfs = Algorithm::BFS->new
    (
        adjacent_nodes_func => $some_func,
        victory_func        => $some_other_func,
    );
    # Get a list (ref) of all the routes from your start node to the node(s)
    # that satisfy the victory condition.
    my $routes_ref = $bfs->search($start_node);

=head1 METHODS

=cut

=head2 new(%params)

Create a new Algorithm::BFS object with the specified parameters.

Required parameters:

    adjacent_nodes_func:
    A function (reference to a sub) that, given a node, returns an array ref
    of adjacent nodes.  If the node has no adjacent nodes, this function must
    return an empty array ref.

    victory_func:
    A function (referenec to a sub) that, given a node, returns a value that
    evaluates to true if and only if the node satisfies the victory condition
    of this search.

Optional parameters:

    include_start_node:
    If this is a true value, then the start node is a candidate for the
    victory condition.  That is, if the start node matches the victory
    condition, then a single route will be returned by the search algorithm,
    and that route will contain only the start node.

    one_result:
    If this is a true value, then the search stops after a single route is
    found, instead of searching for all the routes that satisfy the victory
    condition at the depth of the first route.

sub new
{
    my ($class, %opts) = @_;

    confess 'Missing "adjacent_nodes_func" parameter' unless
        $opts{adjacent_nodes_func};
    confess 'Missing "victory_func" parameter' unless $opts{victory_func};

    my %self =
    (
        adjacent_nodes_func => $opts{adjacent_nodes_func},
        victory_func        => $opts{victory_func},
        include_start_node  => $opts{include_start_node},
        one_result          => $opts{one_result},
    );

    bless(\%self, $class);
}

=head2 search($start_node)

    Perform a breadth-first-search from the specified node until the depth at
    which at least one node satisfies the victory condition.

    Returns an array ref of routes.  Each route is an array ref of the nodes
    that are along the route from the start node to the node at which the
    victory condition was satisfied.  Because this implementation works on
    cyclic graphs, multiple routes may be returned (and, indeed, multiple
    nodes at the same depth level may satisfy the victory condition).  If the
    "one_result" option was passed to the constructor, then only one route
    will be returned, but it will still be encapsulated in another array ref.

                # been seen before, add a route to it to the list of
